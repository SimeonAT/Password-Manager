This is a simple comamnd line password manager I made for fun 
and to what I learned so far in C++. It's not completely finished and 
there's still a few bugs on it, but I'll get back to working on it when I 
become more knowledgable in C++. 

Potential bugs to fix: 
  - Writing the amount of tries onto a separate text file to record 
  how many failed attempts to enter the master password. This will help 
  prevent brute forcing the password. 
  - Encrypting all of the text files, so that people can't just look at the 
  text files for the password information. Program will decrypt everything when launched,
  and encrypt everything before closing.
